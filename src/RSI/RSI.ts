/**
 * Relative Strength Index (RSI)
 * Type: Momentum
 *
 * The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an oscillator that ranges between 0 and 100. The RSI can be used to find trend
 * reversals, i.e. when a downtrend doesn't generate a RSI below 30 and rallies above 70 it could mean that a trend
 * reversal to the upside is taking place. Trend lines and moving averages should be used to validate such statements.
 *
 * The RSI is mostly useful in markets that alternate between bullish and bearish movements.
 *
 * A RSI value of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition (not a good time to sell because there is an oversupply).
 * A RSI value of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition (sell high opportunity because market may correct the
 * price in the near future).
 *
