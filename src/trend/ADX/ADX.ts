/**
 * Average Directional Index (ADX)
 * Type: Trend (using +DI & -DI), Volatility
 *
 * The ADX was developed by John Welles Wilder (Jr.). It is a lagging indicator; that is, a
 * trend must have established itself before the ADX will generate a signal that a trend is under way.
 *
 * ADX will range between 0 and 100 which makes it an oscillator. It is a smoothed average of the Directional Movement
 * Index (DMI / DX).
 *
 * Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength.
 * A strong trend is indicated by readings above 50. ADX values of 75-100 signal an extremely strong trend.
 *
 * Interpretation:
 * If ADX increases, it means that volatility is increasing and indicating the beginning of a new trend.
 * If ADX decreases, it means that volatility is decreasing, and the current trend is slowing down and may even
 * reverse.
 * When +DI is above -DI, then there is more upward pressure than downward pressure in the market.
 *
 * Note:
 * The ADX calculation relies on the DX becoming stable before producing meaningful results.
 * For an interval of 5, at least 9 candles are required. The first 5 candles are used to stabilize the DX, which then generates the initial ADX value.
 * The subsequent 4 candles produce additional ADX values, allowing it to stabilize with 5 values for an interval of 5.
